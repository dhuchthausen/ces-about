                        <h2>Data protection</h2>
                        <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. If personal data (for example name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our web pages, this always takes place to the extent possible on a voluntary basis. This data is not shared with third parties without your express consent.</p>
                        <p>Please note that the transfer of data on the internet (for example via email communication) may have security gaps. Gap-free protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>

Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit our website.</p>
                        <p>You can set your browser so that you are notified about the creation of cookies and to only allow cookies in individual cases, to prevent the acceptance of cookies either generally or in certain cases, and enable the automatic deletion of the cookies upon closing the browser. When cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.</p>

                        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
                        <p>This section only applies to Cloudogu EcoSystem instances available under the domain *.cloudogu.net/p>
                        <p>This website uses functions of the web analytics service Google Analytics. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
                        <p>Google Analytics uses "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and which enable an analysis of your use of the website.

                                <strong>IP anonymization</strong><br/>
                                We have enabled the IP anonymization function on this website. This causes your IP address to be shortened by Google within Member States of the European Union or in other countries party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before being transferred to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide the website operator with other services relating to website and internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.

                        <p>Collection and sharing of information: Using the Google+ interface, you can publish information worldwide. Via the Google+ interface, you and other users receive personalized content from Google and our partners. Google stores both the information that you have given a +1 for some particular content as well as information about the page that you were viewing when you clicked +1. Your +1 can appear along with your profile name and photo in Google services, such as search results or your Google profile, or elsewhere on websites and ads.</p>
                        <p>Google records information about your +1 activity to improve Google services for you and others. To use the Google+ button, you need a public Google profile that is visible worldwide and that must contain at least the name chosen for your profile. This name is used in all Google services. In some cases this name can also replace another name that you have used when sharing content via your Google account. The identity of your Google profile may be displayed to users who know your email address or who have other identifying information about you.</p>
                        <p>Use of collected information: In addition to the uses described above, the information you provide will be used in accordance with the applicable Google privacy policy. Google may publish aggregated statistics about users' +1 activity or share them with users and partners, such as publishers, advertisers, or related websites.</p>
