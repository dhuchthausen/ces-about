<p>Cloudogu GmbH ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://cloudogu.net website (the "Service").</p>
<p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.</p>
<p>We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
<p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. If personal data (for example name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our web pages, this always takes place to the extent possible on a voluntary basis. This data is not shared with third parties without your express consent.</p>
<p>Please note that the transfer of data on the internet (for example via email communication) may have security gaps. Gap-free protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection And Use</strong></p>
<p>While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your email address, name, other information ("Personal Information").</p>
<p><strong>Server log files</strong></p>
<p>The provider of the web pages automatically collects and stores information in the server log files that your browser transfers to us automatically. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser type and version</li>
<li>Operating system used</li>
<li>Referring URL</li>
<li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
<li>Time of the server request</li>
</ul>
<p>This data cannot be assigned to specific persons. A combination of this data with other data sources is not performed. We reserve the right to review this data at a later time if we become aware of any concrete indications of unlawful use.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Our web pages may use “cookies”. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, effective, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit our website.</p>
<p>You can set your browser so that you are notified about the creation of cookies and to only allow cookies in individual cases, to prevent the acceptance of cookies either generally or in certain cases, and enable the automatic deletion of the cookies upon closing the browser. When cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
<p>These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Instances of Cloudogu EcoSystem hosted on the domain cloudogu.net might use fuctions of the web analytics service Google Analytics. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and which enable an analysis of your use of the website. The data generated by the cookie regarding your use of this website is generally transferred to a Google server located in the USA and stored there.</p>
<p>
   <strong>IP anonymization</strong><br/>
   We have enabled the IP anonymization function on this website. This causes your IP address to be shortened by Google within Member States of the European Union or in other countries party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before being transferred to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide the website operator with other services relating to website and internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.                     </p>
<p>
   <strong>Browser plugin</strong><br/>
   You may refuse the storage of cookies via a corresponding setting in your browser software; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and related to your use (including your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a traget="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>

<p>
   <strong>Google Analytics demographics data</strong><br/>
   <p>This website uses the "Demographics" function of Google Analytics. This allows reports to be generated that contain data on the age, gender, and interests of website visitors.</p>

You can disable this function at any time via the display settings in your Google account, or generally refuse the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Objection to data collection".</p>
</p>

<p>This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as requests you send to us as a site operator.

<p>If SSL encryption is activated, the data that you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Links To Other Sites</strong></p>
