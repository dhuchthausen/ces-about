                        51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

                        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    </pre>

                    <h3>Preamble</h3>

                    <p>
                        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
                        Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
                        the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                        Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
                        Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can
                        apply it to your programs, too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
                        sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
                        if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
                        software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
                        the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
                        of the software, or if you modify it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the
                        rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And
                        you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
                        to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty
                        for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
                        to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
                        reflect on the original authors' reputations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of
                        a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
                        To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or
                        not licensed at all.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
                    </p>


                    <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>


                    <p>
                        <strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed
                        by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
                        The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
                        either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
                        the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                        language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
                        licensee is addressed as "you".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
                        The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only
                        if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running
                        the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
                        receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
                        an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer
                        to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program
                        a copy of this License along with the Program.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
                        exchange for a fee.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
                        forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the
                        terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

                        <dd>
                            <strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
                            you changed the files and the date of any change.

                            <strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
                            in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole
                            at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
                        </dd>

                        <dd>
                            <strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
                            must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print
                            or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there
                            is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
                            the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
                            (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
                            your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                        </dd>
                    </dl>

                    <p>
                        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
                        Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this
                        License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.
                        But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program,
                        the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
                        extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contoggle your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
                        the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
                        based on the Program.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
                        on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
                        this License.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
                        2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
                        also do one of the following:
                    </p>

                    <!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
                    <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->

                        <dd>
                            <strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
                            which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
                            for software interchange; or,

                        <dd>
                            <strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
                            any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,
                            a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
                            terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                        </dd>
                        <dt></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
                            corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
                            only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord
                            with Subsection b above.)
                        </dd>
                    </dl>

                    <p>
                        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
                        source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
                        definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
                        However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
                        distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
                        on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
                        the executable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even
                        though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
                        provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
                        Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
                        who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
                        so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
                        nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
                        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
                        the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
                        so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works
                        based on it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the
                        recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify
                        the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
                        the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
                        by third parties to this License.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
                        or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
                        court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                        excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
                        your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                        may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
                        redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
                        then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution
                        of the Program.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section
                        is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contoggle
                        validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
                        free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
                        have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in
                        reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
                        she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
                        choice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
                        either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
                        under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
                        so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
                        License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
                        Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
                        to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
                        that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
                        not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
                        Software Foundation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
                        distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which
                        is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                        make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
                        of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
                        PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
                        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                        OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
                        FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
                        YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
                        CORRECTION.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
                        COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
                        ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
                        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
                        OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
                        OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
                        OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                        <h3>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>

                        <p>Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. Everyone is permitted to
                            copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

                        <p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version
                            3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
                            <br>
                            <br></p>

                        <h4>0. Additional Definitions.</h4>

                        <p>As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and
                            the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

                        <p>“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined
                            Work as defined below.</p>

                        <p>An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is
                            not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is
                            deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

                        <p>A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The
                            particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
                            Version”.
                        </p>

                        <p>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
                            Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation,
                            are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

                        <p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code
                            for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined
                            Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
                            <br>
                            <br></p>

                        <h4>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h4>

                        <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section
                            3 of the GNU GPL.
                            <br>
                            <br></p>

                        <h4>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h4>

                        <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function
                            or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed
                            when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:</p>

                        <p>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
                            Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever
                            part of its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
                            permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
                            <br>
                            <br></p>

                        <h4>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h4>

                        <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of
                            the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the
                            incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,
                            or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
                            the following:</p>

                        <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that
                            the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy
                            of the GNU GPL and this license document.
                            <br>
                            <br></p>

                        <h4>4. Combined Works.</h4>

                        <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not
                            restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
                            engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>

                        <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that
                            the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy
                            of the GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices
                            during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
                            a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. d) Do
                            one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
                            and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the
                            user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to
                            produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
                            Corresponding Source. 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
                            A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on
                            the user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library
                            that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. e) Provide Installation Information, but
                            only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU
                            GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified
                            version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified
                            version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
                            the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you
                            must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
                            for conveying Corresponding Source.)
                            <br>
                            <br></p>

                        <h4>5. Combined Libraries.</h4>

                        <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library
                            together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
                            License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the
                            following:
                        </p>

                        <p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with
                            any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice
                            with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where
                            to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
                            <br>
                            <br></p>

                        <h4>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h4>

                        <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
                            License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                            but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

                        <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies
                            that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version”
                            applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
                            version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as
                            you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you
                            may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software
                            Foundation.
                        </p>

                        <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the
                            GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of
                            any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

                within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted

                acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
                indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
                or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even
                if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                </p>
                <strong>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</strong>. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
                Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
                You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
                and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
                by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
                liability.

                        <h3>Ubuntu is a collection of thousands of computer programs and documents created by a range of individuals,
                            teams and companies.</h3>
                        <p>Each of these programs may come under a different licence. This licence policy describes the process
                            that we follow in determining which software will be included by default in the Ubuntu operating
                            system.</p>
                        <p>Copyright licensing and trademarks are two different areas of law, and we consider them separately
                            in Ubuntu. The following policy applies only to copyright licences. We evaluate trademarks on
                            a case-by-case basis.</p>
                        <h3>Categories of software in Ubuntu</h3>
                        <p>The thousands of software packages available for Ubuntu are organised into four key groups or components:
                            main, restricted, universe and multiverse. Software is published in one of these components based
                            on whether or not it meets our free software philosophy, and the level of support we can provide
                            for it.</p>
                        <p>This policy only addresses the software that you will find in main and restricted, which contain
                            software that is fully supported by the Ubuntu team and must comply with this policy.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Ubuntu 'main' component licence policy</h4>
                        <p>All application software included in the Ubuntu main component:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Must include source code. The main component has a strict and non-negotiable requirement that
                                application software included in it must come with full source code.</li>
                            <li>Must allow modification and distribution of modified copies under the same licence. Just having
                                the source code does not convey the same freedom as having the right to change it. Without
                                the ability to modify software, the Ubuntu community cannot support software, fix bugs, translate
                                it, or improve it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Ubuntu 'main' and 'restricted' component licence policy</h4>
                        <h5>All application software in both main and restricted must meet the following requirements:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Must allow redistribution. Your right to sell or give away the software alone, or as part of
                                an aggregate software distribution, is important because:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You, the user, must be able to pass on any software you have received from Ubuntu in
                                        either source code or compiled form.</li>
                                    <li>While Ubuntu will not charge licence fees for this distribution, you might want to charge
                                        to print Ubuntu CDs, or create your own customised versions of Ubuntu which you sell,
                                        and should have the freedom to do so.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Must not require royalty payments or any other fee for redistribution or modification.It's important
                                that you can exercise your rights to this software without having to pay for the privilege,
                                and that you can pass these rights on to other people on exactly the same basis.</li>
                            <li>Must allow these rights to be passed on along with the software. You should be able to have exactly
                                the same rights to the software as we do.</li>
                            <li>Must not discriminate against persons, groups or against fields of endeavour. The licence of
                                software included in Ubuntu can not discriminate against anyone or any group of users and
                                cannot restrict users from using the software for a particular field of endeavour - a business
                                for example. So we will not distribute software that is licensed "freely for non-commercial
                                use".</li>
                            <li>Must not be distributed under a licence specific to Ubuntu. The rights attached to the software
                                must not depend on the program being part of Ubuntu system. So we will not distribute software
                                for which Ubuntu has a "special" exemption or right, and we will not put our own software
                                into Ubuntu and then refuse you the right to pass it on.</li>
                            <li>Must not contaminate other software licences.The licence must not place restrictions on other
                                software that is distributed along with it. For example, the licence must not insist that
                                all other programmes distributed on the same medium be free software.</li>
                            <li>May require source modifications to be distributed as patches. In some cases, software authors
                                are happy for us to distribute their software and modifications to their software, as long
                                as the two are distributed separately, so that people always have a copy of their pristine
                                code. We are happy to respect this preference. However, the licence must explicitly permit
                                distribution of software built from modified source code.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Documentation, firmware and drivers</h3>
                        <p>Ubuntu contains licensed and copyrighted works that are not application software. For example, the
                            default Ubuntu installation includes documentation, images, sounds, video clips and firmware.
                            The Ubuntu community will make decisions on the inclusion of these works on a case-by-case basis,
                            ensuring that these works do not restrict our ability to make Ubuntu available free of charge,
                            and that you can continue to redistribute Ubuntu.</p>
                        <h3>Software installed by default</h3>
                        <p>When you install Ubuntu, you will typically install a complete desktop environment. It is also possible
                            to install a minimal set of software (just enough to boot your machine) and then manually select
                            the precise software applications to install. Such a "custom" install is usually favoured by
                            server administrators, who prefer to keep only the software they absolutely need on the server.</p>
                        <p>All of the application software installed by default is free software. In addition, we install some
                            hardware drivers that are available only in binary format, but such packages are clearly marked
                            in the restricted component.</p>
